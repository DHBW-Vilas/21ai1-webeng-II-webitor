# Webitor - A web-based Code Editor

## Run on Gitpod

To get the project up and running on [gitpod](https://gitpod.io/), add the repository [https://github.com/DHBW-Vilas/21ai1-webeng-II-webitor](https://github.com/DHBW-Vilas/21ai1-webeng-II-webitor) as a new workspace and run `gp validate`. This should automatically open a browser preview, that opens the website.

## Run locally

To run the project locally, make sure that you have [node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en) installed. Navigate to this project's root directory and run `npm install`. Afterwards, run `npm start` to start the server.

Now you can open your favorite browser and navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
